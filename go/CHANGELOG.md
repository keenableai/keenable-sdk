# Changelog

## Unreleased

`ToContext` (on `SearchResponse` and `Page`) drops markdown images and `<img>`
tags, and resolves relative links against the result's URL (or keeps just the
link text when it cannot). Absolute links are unchanged, and lines left holding
only table pipes are dropped. `MaxChars` counts the cleaned text. `Snippet` and
`Content` are untouched. No migration.

## 0.1.1

`SearchOptions` gains `MaxResults` and `QueryTime`. Both are client-only: the
`keenable_search` tool schema is unchanged. No migration.

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

Search, fetch, `ToContext`, and the `keenable_search` / `keenable_fetch` tools.
Keyless by default. No migration.
